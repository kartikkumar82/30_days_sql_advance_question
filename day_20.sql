Question:
Identifying Trending Songs:
Spotify wants to identify songs that have suddenly gained popularity within a week.

Write a SQL query to find the song_id and week_start 
date of all songs that had a play count increase of 
at least 300% from one week to the next. 
Consider weeks starting on Mondays.
